- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? I went to TA hours on Wednesday night.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? My initial impressions of Java was that some of it reminded me a lot of Python but there are also some things that I have to just get used to adjusting my mindset on.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Alot of the literal code is similar in its structure but Java being object-oriented means you have to approach each project with more planning.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I wanted to use more methods and a better process for changing pronouns. Go to TA hours if you can!
